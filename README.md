# Team-Profile-Generator

<strong> Name </strong>

The name of this app is <i>Team-Profile-Generator</i> as it is designed generate team member's profile.

<strong>Description</strong>

As a web developer, I want a deployed portfolio that can showcase my work to potential employers and clients. It is in that spirit that my instructor gave me and other students this homework to design a web application that users can use to generate team member's profile.

<strong>Programs used</strong>

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, jquery, node.js(OOP) and bootstrap library and of course Git/Github were used as version control.

<strong>Installation</strong>

This is a node js application and does not need installation. it is currently hosted in github and you can access it at https://github.com/Janviermbilizi/Team-Profile-Generator.

<strong>Usage</strong>

This website is simple, clean, easy to use and undertand. When you go to the site, the header displays your today's day and date. below that, it displays a calendar with your work hours, 9 AM to 5PM. if that time is passed, the next column will have a silver color background that says <i> passed time or the event saved</i> and will not allow you to record or save a new event. if that time is a current time, the next column will have a red color background that says <i>current time or the event saved</i> . if that time is a future time, the next column will have a green color background that says coming time or the event saved. they all provide you an input that allows you to record your event or edit it.
