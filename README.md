<strong> Name </strong>

The name of this app is <i>Team-Profile-Generator</i> as it is designed generate team member's profile.

<strong>Description</strong>

As a web developer, I want a deployed portfolio that can showcase my work to potential employers and clients. It is in that spirit that my instructor gave me and other students this homework to design a web application that users can use to generate team member's profile.

<strong>Programs used</strong>

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, jquery, node.js(OOP) and bootstrap library and of course Git/Github were used as version control.

<strong>Installation</strong>

This is a node js application and does not need installation. it is currently hosted in github and you can access it at https://github.com/Janviermbilizi/Team-Profile-Generator.

<strong>Usage</strong>

This application is simple, clean, easy to use and undertand. After cloning, installing node and opening the package in your code editor, you simply open the file Develop/app.js in console, then type node app.js. After that you will be prompt to answer questions related to the employee you want to add (name, id, email, job position and additional information depending on the employee's job position). After the last employee is entered, a output folder will be created automaticly and will contain team.html(page for your team members).
